# About Me

I am a Senior technical Cloud Engineer and Principal Architect operating as an Azure and Kubernetes Subject Matter Expert.

I've got 10+ years in Azure, starting with document writing and VM creation in ASM in 2015. In that time, I've built everything from cloud landing zones, to multi-region failover Kubernetes clusters, to App Services serving out public sites that receive tens of thousands of visits per month.

I'm an experienced Terraform engineer, and have solved some crunchy problems with IaC both in consulting and a short stint at Hashi.

When I'm not working, I'm focused on raising my family, and pondering- among other things- space, perception, economics, social contract, and the meaningfulness of a life well-lived.
